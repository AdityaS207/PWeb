To keep our website from indexing, we can use robots.txt

On the Apache server, we can use <.htaccess> to see another part of the website

Then, in Macs, a <.DS_Store> file stores the configurations for how the desktop looks (eg. icon location, etc.) Changing

When we found './JIFxzHyW8W', we can see the <./> and maybe we can use that to see directory on website
Example : 
	http://mercury.picoctf.net:37669/index.html ==
	we can go with : 
	http://mercury.picoctf.net:37669/JIFxzHyW8W ==
After use this, some file was downloaded to the computer and maybe there is a clue to solve the prob :)

UTF-8 is a Unicode character encoding method. This means that UTF-8 takes the code point for a given Unicode character and translates it into a string of binary. It also does the reverse, reading in binary digits and converting them back to characters.
== Unicode is a character set. UTF-8 is encoding. == 

Maybe there is a secret clue in the robots.txt on website exploitation

When it come to cookies, the first thing we can do is see the admin. If we are not ht admin, we need to find a clue
we can change the cookies to find another clue, or we can change admin status or value from 'False'(0) to 'True'(1)
