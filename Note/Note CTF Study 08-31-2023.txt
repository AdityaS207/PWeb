XML external entity(XXE) injection
=> this is a XML vulnerability that allows attack to interfere with an application's processing of XML data.

To perform an XXE injection attack that retrieves an arbitrary file from the server's filesystem, you need to modify the submitted XML in two ways:

Introduce (or edit) a DOCTYPE element that defines an external entity containing the path to the file.
Edit a data value in the XML that is returned in the application's response, to make use of the defined external entity.

<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>

The application performs no particular defenses against XXE attacks, so you can exploit the XXE vulnerability to retrieve the /etc/passwd
